# üì∑ ESP32-CAM Face Recognition with Relay Control

## üìù Overview
This project uses the **ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker)** to perform **face recognition** and trigger a **relay** upon a successful match.  
Typical use case: unlocking a door, activating a switch, or powering a device only when a known face is detected.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- ESP32-CAM AI-Thinker  
- Relay Module (5V, usually Active-LOW)  
- Stable 5V / 2A power supply (critical for reliable operation)  
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO with ESP32 board support  

---

## üîå Wiring
| Component | ESP32-CAM Pin |
|-----------|---------------|
| Relay IN  | GPIO33        |
| Relay VCC | 5V            |
| Relay GND | GND           |

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid using GPIO0, GPIO2, or GPIO12 (boot pins). GPIO33 is safe and does not conflict with the camera.

## üìÇ Project Files
- **sketch.ino** ‚Üí Main Arduino sketch (camera + Wi-Fi + relay logic).  
- **camera_pins.h** ‚Üí Pin mapping for ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker).  
- **app_httpd.cpp** ‚Üí Web server file (from CameraWebServer example) modified to set `matchFace = true` when a face match occurs.  

---

## üöÄ Setup & Usage
1. Open the sketch in Arduino IDE.  
2. Select **ESP32 Wrover Module** and enable **PSRAM**.  
3. Update your Wi-Fi credentials in the code:  
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
   const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
   ```
4. Upload the code to ESP32-CAM via USB-TTL.  
5. Open Serial Monitor @115200 baud ‚Üí find your device IP.  
6. Access `http://<IP_ADDRESS>` in a browser.  
7. Enable **Face Recognition** from the web UI.  
8. When a registered face is detected, the relay turns **ON** for 5 seconds.

## ü§ñ Algorithms
Powered by [**esp-who**](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who) and the **esp-face** library:  
- **MTCNN** ‚Üí Face Detection  
- **MobileFaceNet** ‚Üí Feature Extraction  
- **kNN / Euclidean Distance** ‚Üí Face Matching

## üîÑ Process Flow

A high-level illustration of how the system works:

1. ESP32-CAM captures an image.  
2. MTCNN detects faces.  
3. MobileFaceNet extracts embeddings.  
4. kNN compares with stored faces.  
5. Relay activates if a match is found.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Relay is connected to **GPIO33**.  
- Most relay modules are **Active-LOW**. Adjust in code if yours is Active-HIGH:  
  ```cpp
  #define RELAY_ON  HIGH
  #define RELAY_OFF LOW
  ```
- Always power ESP32-CAM with a **5V/2A supply** for stable operation.

- Face-activated switches  
- IoT security systems  
- Educational computer vision projects
