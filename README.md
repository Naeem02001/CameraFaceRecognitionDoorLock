# üì∑ ESP32-CAM Face Recognition with Servo Control

## üìù Overview
This project uses the **ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker)** to perform **face recognition** and trigger a **servo motor** upon a successful match.  
Typical use case: unlocking a small door latch, opening a lock, or activating a mechanism only when a known face is detected.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
- ESP32-CAM AI-Thinker  
- Servo Motor (e.g., SG90 / MG90S)  
- Stable 5V / 2A power supply (ESP32-CAM + Servo)  
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO with ESP32 board support  

---

## üîå Wiring
| Component    | ESP32-CAM Pin |
|--------------|---------------|
| Servo Signal | GPIO2         |
| Servo VCC    | 5V (external supply recommended) |
| Servo GND    | GND (shared with ESP32-CAM)      |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
- GPIO2 is a boot pin; make sure the servo does not pull it HIGH/LOW during reset.  
- Always use an **external 5V supply** for the servo and connect grounds together.  

---

## üìÇ Project Files
- **sketch.ino** ‚Üí Main Arduino sketch (camera + Wi-Fi + servo logic).  
- **camera_pins.h** ‚Üí Pin mapping for ESP32-CAM (AI-Thinker).  
- **app_httpd.cpp** ‚Üí Web server file (from CameraWebServer example) modified to set `matchFace = true` when a face match occurs.  

---

## üöÄ Setup & Usage
1. Open the sketch in Arduino IDE.  
2. Select **ESP32 Wrover Module** and enable **PSRAM**.  
3. Update your Wi-Fi credentials in the code:  
   ```cpp
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_SSID";
   const char* password = "YOUR_PASSWORD";
   ```
4. Upload the code to ESP32-CAM via USB-TTL.  
5. Open Serial Monitor @115200 baud ‚Üí find your device IP.  
6. Access `http://<IP_ADDRESS>` in a browser.  
7. Enable **Face Recognition** from the web UI.  
8. When a registered face is detected, the servo rotates (e.g., 0¬∞ ‚Üí 90¬∞ for 5 seconds).

1. ESP32-CAM captures an image.  
2. MTCNN detects faces.  
3. MobileFaceNet extracts embeddings.  
4. kNN compares with stored faces.  
5. Servo motor rotates if a match is found.  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Servo is connected to **GPIO2**.  
- Use `myServo.write(0)` for default position and `myServo.write(90)` for open position. Adjust angles as needed.  
- Always power the servo with an **external 5V supply** and connect GND to ESP32-CAM GND.  

---

## üìå Applications
- Smart door lock (servo opens latch)  
- Face-activated locker  
- IoT projects with mechanical movement  
- Educational computer vision projects
